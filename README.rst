SDI bridge
==========

This repository contains PCB design files for a small PCB adapter converting SDI input signal into parallel format.
Signal conversion is implemented with a `Semtech GS2971A <https://www.semtech.com/products/broadcast-video/receivers-deserializers/gs2971a>`_ deserializer.
The design was created in KiCad.
