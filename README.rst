SDI bridge
==========

This repository contains PCB design files for a small PCB adapter allowing to convert SDI input signal in to parallel form.
Signal conversion is implemented with `Semtech GS2971A <https://www.semtech.com/products/broadcast-video/receivers-deserializers/gs2971a>`_ deserializer.
